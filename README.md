iesor-nsga-validation
=====================

Testing for IESoR and NSGA-II evolution validity. Why is this not just a test inside node-iesor? Evolution and IESoR are each validated to be properly running small evolution/loading objects into simulation. However, real tests are long term automated evolution runs yielding functioning ambulation (like original ECAL 2013 paper on IESoR domain)
